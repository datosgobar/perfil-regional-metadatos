Regional Metadata Profile
===

# Introduction

The Regional Metadata Profile (RMP) is an initiative of the Open Data Group of the Organization of American States (OAS).

With this metadata profile, the group aims to build a common baseline between countries of the region that can be a reference and ease initiatives that need to implement open data catalogues, re-using common solutions.

# Design principles

The RMP was designed following these principles:

* **Re-use what already exists**: if something was solved by someone else, it is better to use that solution rather than inventing a new one.
* **It is better a standard that many use.. rather than a perfect one**: solutions that are already broadly used guarantee adoption and a minimum of interoperability.
* **Better using a standard.. than none**: if there is a use case not covered by any known standard, it is preferable to think a general and re-usable solution, rather than a specific one that can be hard to escalate or interoperate with other systems.

Following this 3 principles as guidelines, the Regional Metadata Profile:

* **It is based on european application of DCAT (DCAT-AP)**. Takes the metadata profile for implementing open data catalogues more broadly used as a baseline, and extends it.
* **Follows same extensibility philosophy than DCAT**
    - Preserves the use of all mandatory fields.
    - If a non mandatory field is defined in the baseline, it is preferable using that one before creating a new one.
    - Creates new metadata fields, solving use cases not included in DCAT-AP.
* **Re-use solutions already in use by countries of the region**. Adding additional metadata fields from the previous use experience in other countries.
* **Define variable names in English and _lowerCamelCase_**, following DCAT style.
