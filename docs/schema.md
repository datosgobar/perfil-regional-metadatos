Defines a list of themes that can be used to classify datasets in this catalogue. If there is at least one dataset classified as having one or more themes in the catalogue, this metadata field is mandatory because it is neccessary to make explicit the theme taxonomy available to use a theme for a dataset.

For national catalogues, or others that have a broad variety datasets of different themes, it is recommended to use the European Union theme taxonomy (see standards/themeTaxonomy in the repository). This taxonomy has 13 general themes, under wicho any dataset can be classified. Nevertheless, some countries could prefer to develop a more detailed theme taxonomy, with more specific themes.                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td><td>[{...}, {...}]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </td><td>themeTaxonomy        </td><td>Array          </td></tr>

It is neccesary that tags are well written, in plural and keeping an eye of previous tags. Tags are useful por users search. The longer and homogeneous is the list of tags, their efficiency will be better.

The time period has an initial date and an end date, separated by "/", written in ISO 8601 format using only date part or date & time depending on the precission needed. Optionally, a single date can be specified (instead of two) and this one will be interpreted as an initial date, while the end date will remain unspecified (useful for datasets that are chronologically updated).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>2015-01-01/2015-12-31

a) of countries, provinces, departments, counties, municipalities or cities, under the recommendations of the guide of territorial and administrative units of the country that is managing the catalogue.
b) an area of coordinates (or bounding box) represented by latitude / longitude in this order: minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, maximum latitude.
c) a geographical point represented by latitude / longitude.

a) of countries, provinces, departments, counties, municipalities or cities, under the recommendations of the guide of territorial and administrative units of the country that is managing the catalogue.
b) an area of coordinates (or bounding box) represented by latitude / longitude in this order: minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, maximum latitude.
c) a geographical point represented by latitude / longitude.
d) if the geographical reference is not included in the official guide of territorial and administrative units of the country, can be referenced using a geonames URI from geonames.org as: http://sws.geonames.org/6255146</td><td>"ARG" is the code for Argentina.

A certain region or place. Can have different values:

a) of countries, provinces, departments, counties, municipalities or cities, under the recommendations of the guide of territorial and administrative units of the country that is managing the catalogue.
b) an area of coordinates (or bounding box) represented by latitude / longitude in this order: minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, maximum latitude.
c) a geographical point represented by latitude / longitude.
d) if the geographical reference is not included in the official guide of territorial and administrative units of the country, can be referenced using a geonames URI from geonames.org as: http://sws.geonames.org/6255146                                                                                          </td><td>"ARG" is the code for Argentina.
